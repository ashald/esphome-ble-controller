This component provides a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) controller for [ESPHome](https://esphome.io). It allows to monitor sensor data and control switches and other components via BLE connections (for example from a smart phone):

![BLE connection from phone](BLE-Services-and-Characteristics.png)

In addition, there is a command channel, which allows to configure the WiFi credentials for the ESP32 over BLE (among other things).

⚠️ **Note**: This controller only works with ESP32 micro-controllers, not with ESP8266 chips because they do not offer built-in BLE support.

## Installation
This component is compatible with ESPHome 2021.11.0 or later. (For ESPHome versions before 2021.10, please try release 0.4.0 of this component.) To install this component you do not need to download or copy anything, you can just refer to this external component from the yaml file as shown below.

## Configuration

### Getting started

The following configuration shows how to make a (template) switch accessible via BLE:
```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://wifwucite/esphome-ble-controller

switch:
  - platform: template
    name: "Template Switch"
    optimistic: true
    id: template_switch

esp32_ble_controller:
  services:
  - service: "4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331915d"
    characteristics:
      - characteristic: "beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26ab"
        exposes: template_switch
```

You define your sensors, switches and other compoments as usual (like the [template switch](https://esphome.io/components/switch/template.html) in the example). 
Make sure to assign an id to each component you want to expose via bluetooth. 
Then you add `esp32_ble_controller` to include the controller itself. 
In order to make a component available you need to define a corresponding BLE characteristic that is contained in a BLE service. If you are not familiar with BLE you do need to worry much. For each characteristic and each service you simply need a different UUID, which you could generate [here](https://www.uuidgenerator.net). A service is basically used for grouping characteristics, so it can contain multiple characteristics. Each characteristic exposes a component, which is configured via the `exposes` property specifying the id of the respective component.

If you flash this example configuration and connect to your ESP32 device from your phone or tablet, you can see device information similar to the data displayed in the image above. Note how the service UUID and characteristic UUID provided in the characteristic configuration of the template switch now show up. Besides the switch that was configured explicitly there is also a so-called maintenance service which is provided by the controller automatically. It allows you to send commands to your device and access some logging related characteristics, which will be explained below.

### Configuration options

```yaml
esp32_ble_controller:
  services:
  - service: <service 1 UUID>
    characteristics:
      - characteristic: <characteristic 1.1 UUID>
        exposes: <id of component>
      - characteristic: <characteristic 1.2 UUID>
        exposes: <id of component>
  - service: <service 2 UUID>
    characteristics:
      - characteristic: <characteristic 2.1 UUID>
        exposes: <id of component>

  # you can add your own custom commands
  # The description is shown when the user sends "help test-cmd" as command.
  commands:
  - command: test-cmd
    description: just a test
    on_execute:
    - logger.log: "test command executed"

  # allows to enable or disable security, default is 'secure'
  # Options:
  # - none: 
  #     disables security
  # - bond:
  #     no real security, but devices do some bonding (pairing) upon first connect
  # - secure:
  #     enables secure connections and man-in-the-middle protection
  # If the "on_show_pass_key" automation is present, then upon first pairing the other device (your phone) 
  # sends a 6-digit pass key to the ESP and the ESP is supposed to display it so that it can be entered on the other device.
  # This automation is not available for the "none" mode, optional for the "bond" mode, and required for the "secure" mode.
  security_mode: secure

  # Whether to expose the maintenance service, which allows viewing logs, or executing commands.
  # When set to 'false', the service is not exposed.
  # Useful when security is set to 'none' so there is no risk that the node will be abused.
  expose_maintenance_service: true

  # automation that is invoked when the pass key should be displayed, the pass key is available in the automation as "pass_key" variable of type std::string (not available if security mode is "none")
  # the example below just logs the pass keys
  on_show_pass_key:
  - logger.log:
      format: "pass key is %s"
      args: 'pass_key.c_str()'
  # automation that is invoked when the authentication is complete, the boolean "success" indicates success or failure (not available if security mode is "none")
  on_authentication_complete:
  - logger.log:
      format: "BLE authentication complete %d" # shows 1 on success, 0 on failure
      args: 'success'
  # automations that are invoked when the device is connected to / disconnected from a client (phone or tablet for example)
  on_connected:
  - logger.log: "I am connected. :-)"
  on_disconnected:
  - logger.log: "I am disconnected. :-("
```

## Features

### BLE security

By default security is switched on, which means that the ESP32 has to be bonded (paired) when it is used for the first time with a new device. (This feature can be switched off via configuration.) Secure connections and protection against man-in-the-middle attacks are enabled. The device to be bonded sends a pass key (a 6 digit PIN) to the ESP32. Via the `on_show_pass_key` automation you can log the pass key or even show it on a display. (At the bottom you can find an example that makes use of a display to show the pass key until pairing is complete.)

Note: On some computers (like the MacBook Pro for example) the very first bonding process seems to fail if the security is enabled. In that case you can change the security mode to "bond" for the very first encounter (without an `on_show_pass_key` automation). After that succeeded you may change the mode back to "secure". Even if you delete the bonding information from both devices later on, secure bonding attempts will work and recreate the bonding.

### Maintenance service

The maintenance BLE service is provided implicitly when you include `esp32_ble_controller` in your yaml configuration. It provides two characteristics:

* Command channel (UTF-8 string, read-write):
Allows to send commands to the ESP32 and receives answers back from it. A command is a string which consists of the name of the command and (possibly) arguments, separated by spaces.
You can define your own custom commands in yaml as described below in detail.
There are also some built-in commands, which are always available:
  * help [&lt;command>]:
    Without argument, it lists all available commands. When the name of a command is given like in "help log-level" it displays a specific description for this command.
  * ble-services [on|off]:
    Switches the component related (non-maintenance) BLE services on or off. You may wonder why one should switch off these services. On most ESP32 boards both BLE and WiFi share the same physical 2,4 GHz antenna on the ESP32. So, too much traffic on both of them can cause it to crash and reboot. Short-lived WiFi connections for sending MQTT messages work fine with services enabled. However, when connecting to the [web server](https://esphome.io/components/web_server.html) or for [OTA updates](https://esphome.io/components/ota.html) services should be disabled. (Note that ESPHome permits configurations without the WiFi component, so if you encounter problems with BLE you could try disabling WiFi completely.)
  * wifi-config &lt;ssid> &lt;password> [hidden]:
    Sets the SSID and the password to use for connecting to WiFi. The optional 'hidden' argument marks the network as hidden network. It is recommended to use this command only when security is enabled. You can also use "wifi-config clear" to clear the WiFi configuration; then the default credentials (compiled into the firmware) will be used. (This command is only available if the WiFi component has been configured at all.)
  * parings [clear]:
    Lists the addresses of all paired devices, or clears all paired devices.
  * version:
    Shows the version of the device. (Currently this displays the compilation time.)
  * log-level [level]: 
    If no argument is provided, it queries the current log level for logging over BLE. When a level argument is provided like in "log-level 0" the log level is adjusted. Currently the levels have to be specified as integer number between 0 (= no logging) and 7 (= very verbose).  
      ⚠️ **Note**: You cannot get finer logging than the overall log level specified for the [logger component](https://esphome.io/components/logger.html).
* Log messages (UTF-8 string, read-only):  
Provides the latest log message that matches the configured log level.

#### Custom commands

 A custom commmand consists of three parts: name, description (shown by help) and the `on_execute` automation that is executed when the command runs. A custom command can have arguments which are passed to the automation as a vector of strings named `arguments`. In addition a custom command send a result, which can be defined by assigning a string to the `result` argument or via the `ble_cmd.send_result` automation (similar to [`logger.log`](https://esphome.io/components/logger.html)). Both variants are shown below.
 
 ```yaml
esp32_ble_controller:
  commands:
  - command: test-cmd
    description: just a test
    on_execute:
    - if:
        condition:
          lambda: 'return arguments.empty();'
        then:
          - lambda: |-
              result = "test command executed without arguments";
        else:
          - ble_cmd.send_result:
              format: "test command executed with argument %s"
              args: 'arguments[0].c_str()'
```

### Supported components

* [Binary sensor](https://esphome.io/components/binary_sensor/index.html) (read-only, 2-byte unsigned little-endian integer): The characteristic stores the boolean sensor value as integer (0 or 1).
* [Sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/index.html) (read-only, 4-byte little-endian float): The characteristic stores the floating point sensor value (without unit).
* [Text sensor](https://esphome.io/components/text_sensor/index.html) (read-only, UTF-8 string): The characteristic stores the string sensor value.
* [Switch](https://esphome.io/components/switch/index.html) (read-write, 2-byte unsigned little-endian integer): The characteristic represents the on-off state of the switch as integer value (0 or 1). Writing a 0 or 1 can be used to turn the switch on or off.
* [Fan](https://esphome.io/components/fan/index.html) (read-write, UTF-8 string): The characteristic represents the complete state of the fan (not only on-off, also speed, oscillating, and direction). Writing a string option can be used to change the on-off state ("on"/"off"), the speed (an integer value), the oscillating ("yes"/"no"), or the direction ("forward"/"reverse"). You can set more than option at a time: "on 45 no" would turn the fan on set its speed to 45 and switch oscillation off.
